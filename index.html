            <p>Hello, my name is Matthew Gifford.  I live in Washington state, about 10 miles Southeast of Seattle.  My hobbies include playing video games, board games, tabletop roleplaying games, pretty much any type of game.  I also like to collect games, especially Monoply.  I have collected about 10 different versions of Monopoly.  I also have about a dozen different tabletop roleplayimg books.  I currently play a weekly game of Cyberpunk Red with my friends, which we livestream on Twitch.  I work at Vertex Inc. as a product support specialist.  I am currently working on getting my Software Development degree to help get a promotion at work.</p>
